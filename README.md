# Advanced System programming:

This project deals with deadlock, concurrency issues in terms of both **user level interface** and lower level **device driver**.

All the code are developed under Ubuntu 18.04 version. If the code is run in other version, it may not work. 

Further debug will be done in the future.

There are 7 assignments for this course.

	- Multi-process calendar/email filter.

	- Multi-thread & producer, consumer calendar/email filter.

	- Concurrenct, deadlock free banck account transfer program.

	- mmap implementation of producer, consumer calendar/email filter.

	- Simple scull driver: automatic multiple registering and making driver nodes.

	- Crack up deadlock and data race conditions for a given driver.

	- NUM lock and CAPS lock LED control flow for USB keyboard driver.

case2:

open + ioctrl + write + ioctrl

1. There are 3 threads: T0, T1, T2.

2. Main thread opens a file in mode 1. T2 changes mode into mode 2, T1 write "Hello Device Driver!" into file and read
from the file. 

3. Note that there are 2 files opened in mode 2. So, devc->count == 2. T0 tries to change mode into mode 1, however
it cannot proceed because ioctl waits until only 1 file in mode 2 exists. 

4. File can only be closed when program reaches to pthread_join(), which will not happen because T0 should
terminate first but it can not.

5. Therefore, a deadlock occurs.
